1. Apple Store SQL Analysis
   
   In my SQL analysis of the Apple Store, I delved into the data to identify the top-performing apps based on various metrics.
   By querying the database and running SQL queries, I was able to extract valuable insights into app popularity, user ratings.
   Additionally, I looked into app categories and genres to identify trends and patterns in user preferences.
   It enables informed decision-making and strategic planning for app developers and marketers.
